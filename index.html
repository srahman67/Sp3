                <h3>Python Fundamentals</h3>
                <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for various purposes such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use, making it an excellent language for beginners and experienced developers alike.

                    Python's fundamental features include its dynamic typing, which means that variable types are determined at runtime, and its use of indentation to delimit code blocks, which promotes readability and reduces syntax errors. Python also includes a large standard library with modules for common tasks, such as string manipulation, file input/output, and networking.</p>
